## RACE PACE CONCEPT

Race Pace is an online application for calculating finish times in popular running race distances: Marathon, Half Marathon, 10km and 5km. Race Pace allows the user to calculate either the pace required to reach a target race finish time, or their race finish time if they run at a user-specified average pace. 

Race Pace will also provide split information to help guide the runner through their race. The split information is times that the runner should be passing certain distance markers in their race. 

Race Pace will work in either kilometers or miles based on the user's preference.

### Target Audience:

- Runners who want to know how to pace their race to achieve a target finish time.
- Runners who want to know what their finish time will be if they run a particular pace in their race.
- Runners who want to improve their race times and race pacing.
- Coaches working with runners to improve their race times and race pacing.

## HOW TO USE RACE PACE

Users are guided through screens to generate the pacing information. Race Pace returns personalised information, so the first stage is for the user to input their first name.

The user selects their race distance: Marathon, Half Marathon, 10km, 5km. All calculations will be based on their selection.

The user selects their prefered units: kilometers or miles. All calculations will be based on their selection.

The user can then select whether they have a target finish time and would like to calculate the required pace to achieve the target. Or, whether they have a target pace and would like to know what finish time this would produce in their race.

Once this selection is made Race Pace calculates and returns the finish time and the pace, together with split times for given distance markers in the race.
